# Entanglement Revisited

The files here are about the CHSH inequality and contains my research notes and considerations.
In particular the classically anticipated individual expectation values \<ZZ\>, \<XX\>, \<XZ\>, and \<ZX\>.
How are they related to the CHSH inequality from QM point of view. 
Jupiter notebook for running calculations related to the CHSH inequality on a quantum computer,
and comparing the analytic expressions, the simulations, and the IBM Q-experience runs.
  
Now when I think about the Classical-Quantum CHSH/Bell paradox it is hard to me to see the real problem.
If \<ZZ\>, \<XX\>, \<XZ\>, and \<ZX\> are viewed as measurements about an object/system 
then the CHSH correlations are very well quantified by the angle theta... 
This is making me wonder how is CHSH(theta) different from measuring the property of a geometric object?
Say a sphere, or cube, or anything else where there is a correlation between size, area, and volume?
  
I would admit that there is a problem if one can force the measurement outcomes to be only +1 or only -1,
but as far as I have seen, the A or B measurement is free to produce +1 or -1 
and only after postprocessing one can see the corelations. It seems that time playes no role at all beyond
making sure that one is looking at the same object/system.
